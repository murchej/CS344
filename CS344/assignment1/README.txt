To compile my program:

1. The command to compile the program: gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies movies.c

2. Enter the executable in the command line: ./movies along with the name of the csv file
 -Example: ./movies movies_sample_1.csv

3. If you do not input the csv file initially, the program will ask you for it until you do so.

4. Once you have provided the command line argument of the csv file name, it will read out that it has processed the file and parsed data for "x" amount of movies.

5. The UI will appear and you may make your selection by entering either 1,2, or 3, or you can exit by entering 4.

Note: VScode says that there are two errors but the code runs just fine :)
